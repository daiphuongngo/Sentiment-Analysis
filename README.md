Building a system for business insights & analysis using Natural Language Processing of customer dialogs & participating in Project Planning, Data Operations, Model Engineering, Machine Learning, Visualization while using at all production stages: 

-	SQL (extract, organize data from customer conversations on Facebook Fan Page), 

-	Python (conduct Exploratory Data Analysis to refine datasets, use SQLAlchemy as Object Relation Mapper on Virtual Environment to read, insert CSV files, translate Python classes to created tables on the relational database) 

-	TablePlus (create & design tables in the relational database for receiving datasets from Python & execute SQL queries),

-	Tableau (visualize refined datasets for insights of customer sentiment), Docker (run & manage applications), 

-	Kubeflow (build & experiment with Machine Learning pipelines), 

-	Tensorflow (examine existing recommended Machine Learning models to apply the best ones for sentiment analysis)
